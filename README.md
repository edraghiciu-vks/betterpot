# 🎵 Betterpot - Ultra-Fast audio player with Beatport support



A modern, high-performance music player powered by the Beatport API powered by a custom built TypeScript/Bun client for the Beatport API v4 



## 🏗️ Monorepo Structure## 🎯 How It Works



This project is organized as a monorepo with clear separation of concerns. 
_

## 🚀 Tech Stack## 🏗️ Architecture



### Frontend``
- **SolidJS** 

- **Vite**

- **TypeScript** - Full type safetyAPI: Beatport v4

- **Web Audio API**

### Backend

- **Bun**

- **Hono**

- **TypeScript** - Shared types with frontend
- **Automatic Client ID Scraping**: Fetches the public `client_id` that Beatport uses for their documentation

3. **Manual Token Fallback**: Direct token input for troubleshooting

### Development Tools

- **Turborepo** - Parallel builds and caching##

- **TypeScript Project References** - Incremental compilation

- **Bun Testing** - Fast test executionBeatport's API v3 was discontinued and they don't currently offer normal developer access. However, their documentation site uses a public `client_id` for testing - this is what we use, just like the beets plugin does.



## ⚡ Performance Benefits## 🚧 Next Steps



### Why SolidJS for Music Player?- ✅ Add token persistence to file

- **No Virtual DOM** = No audio interruptions during UI updates- 🚧 Add token refresh logic  

- **6KB Bundle** vs React's 42KB = Faster loading- 🚧 Build API wrapper methods for common endpoints

- **Fine-grained Reactivity** = Perfect for real-time audio controls- 🚧 Create REST API server for your frontend

- **60fps Animations** = Smooth visualizations- 🚧 Add React/Astro frontend components



### Why This Architecture?## 🧪 Testing

- **Monorepo** = Code sharing and consistent tooling

- **Workspace Packages** = Modular, reusable componentsComprehensive unit tests ensure reliability without hitting the real API:

- **Stateless Auth** = Infinite scalability

- **No Database** = Simplified deployment```bash

# Run all tests

## 🛠️ Development Commandsbun test



### Setup# Run tests in watch mode

```bashbun test --watch

# Install all dependencies and build packages

bun run setup# Run specific test file

bun test token-manager.test.ts

# Or step by step:```

bun install

bun run build:packages**Test Coverage:**

```- ✅ **TokenManager**: 23/23 tests passing (100%)

- ✅ **BeatportAPI**: 23/23 tests passing (100%)

### Development- ✅ **Total**: 46/46 tests passing (100%)

```bash

# Start both API and web app in parallelAll tests use realistic mocks to avoid API calls. See `TEST_RESULTS.md` for detailed coverage.

bun run dev

## 📁 Project Files

# Start individual services

bun run dev:api     # API server on :8000- `index.ts` - Main API client with authentication

bun run dev:web     # Web app on :3000- `token-manager.ts` - Token persistence and management

```- `*.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests

- `beatport_token.json` - Stored authentication token (auto-generated)

### Building- `.env` - Your credentials (create from .env.example)

```bash

# Build all packages and apps## 🛠️ Development

bun run build

Built with:

# Build only shared packages- **Bun** - Fast JavaScript runtime

bun run build:packages- **TypeScript** - Type safety

```- **Fetch API** - HTTP requests

- **No Python** - Pure TypeScript solution! install dependencies:

### Testing

```bash```bash

# Run all testsbun install

bun run test```



# Watch modeTo run:

bun run test:watch

```bash

# Test specific packagebun run index.ts

cd packages/betterpot-client && bun test```

```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.21. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` files in the root directory:

```bash
# Authentication (choose one method)
BEATPORT_USERNAME=your_username
BEATPORT_PASSWORD=your_password

# OR manual token method:
BEATPORT_TOKEN={"access_token":"...","expires_in":36000}

# Optional
BEATPORT_CLIENT_ID=custom_client_id
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Development URLs
- **Web App**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Server**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Health**: http://localhost:8000/health

### 🚀 GitHub Codespaces Support

This project includes a complete devcontainer configuration for GitHub Codespaces:

- **One-click setup** - Automatic Bun installation and project setup
- **Pre-configured environment** - All development tools included
- **Port forwarding** - Automatic forwarding for web app and API
- **VS Code extensions** - TypeScript, Tailwind, Bun support, and more

**Quick start**: Click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace"

See [`.devcontainer/README.md`](.devcontainer/README.md) for detailed information.

## 📦 Package Details

### `@betterpot/betterpot-client`
- Extracted from your working codebase
- 46/46 tests passing
- Full Beatport API integration
- Token management with persistence

### `@betterpot/shared-types`
- Common TypeScript definitions
- API request/response types
- Audio player interfaces
- Beatport entity types

### `@betterpot/ui-kit`

## 🔄 Migration from Original Structure

Your existing functionality has been carefully extracted:

- `index.ts` → `packages/betterpot-client/src/api.ts`
- `token-manager.ts` → `packages/betterpot-client/src/token-manager.ts`
- `*.test.ts` → `packages/betterpot-client/tests/`
- Types extracted to `packages/shared-types/`

**All your tests still pass!** The core API functionality is preserved while being reorganized for scalability.

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### Production Build
```bash
bun run build
```

### Docker Support (Future)
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimal size
FROM oven/bun:alpine AS base
# ... (deployment configuration)
```

### Vercel/Railway Deployment
The monorepo structure is optimized for modern deployment platforms with automatic workspace detection.
